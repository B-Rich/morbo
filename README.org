* Morbo

Morbo is a multiboot binary intended to be loaded from Grub or a
similar multiboot-capable boot loader. It tries to find a
OHCI-compatible Firewire controller on your PCI bus and enable
physical DMA. After that it boots the first multiboot module.

Some diagnostics are printed on the serial console.

If morbo cannot find an OHCI-compliant controller, it will complain,
but continue.
